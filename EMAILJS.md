```Let's start by including the EmailJS library in your static website's HTML. You can do this by adding a <script> tag to the <head> or the <body> section of your HTML file. It's generally recommended to place it at the end of the <body> so it doesn't block the initial rendering of your page.```

```Here's the code snippet you need to add:```

<script type="text/javascript"
        src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@emailjs/browser@3/dist/email.min.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript">
  (function() {
    emailjs.init('YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY');
  })();
</script>

```Explanation:

The first <script> tag loads the EmailJS browser library from a CDN (Content Delivery Network). This makes the emailjs object and its functions available in your JavaScript code.
The second <script> tag contains a small piece of JavaScript code that initializes EmailJS with your Public Key. You will need to replace 'YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY' with the actual Public Key that EmailJS provides in your account dashboard. You can usually find your Public Key on the EmailJS website under the "Account" settings or on the main dashboard.
Steps to Take:

Locate your EmailJS Public Key: Go to your EmailJS account in your web browser. Look for your Public Key. It's a string of characters.
Add the code to your HTML: Open the HTML file for your website (specifically the page with the scheduling form). Paste the two <script> tags provided above either in the <head> section or just before the closing </body> tag.
Replace the placeholder: In the second <script> tag, replace 'YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY' with your actual EmailJS Public Key. Make sure to keep the single quotes around your key.
Once you've done this, the EmailJS library will be ready to use in your JavaScript code to send emails when your form is submitted.```
