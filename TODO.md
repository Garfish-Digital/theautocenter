## Minor Issues & Suggestions
- Open Graph URLs
    Update og:url and og:image to your actual deployed domain, not https://yourdomain.com/.
Social Links

- The LinkedIn link in the footer is generic (https://www.linkedin.com/). If you don’t have a business LinkedIn, consider removing it.

- For advanced SEO, consider adding JSON-LD structured data for Local Business. This helps Google understand your business details.

Canonical Link
    Update link to actual deployment domain, not "https://yourdomain.com/"

- Twitter Cards
    Not needed if you don’t use Twitter, but harmless if included.

- Image Sizes
    For Open Graph, use an image at least 1200x630px for best results.
